# GitHub Visibility Enhancement Guide

## 1. Repository Topics (Tags)

GitHub topics are crucial for discoverability. Add relevant topics to your repository:

### How to Add Topics
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Topics" section
4. Add these recommended topics:

```
obsidian, obsidian-md, vault-merger, note-taking, knowledge-management, 
markdown, python, cli-tool, gui-application, productivity, 
content-deduplication, file-synchronization, obsidian-plugin, 
note-management, vault-management, desktop-application
```

## 2. Repository Description and Website

### Optimize Your Repository Description
Update your repository description to be SEO-friendly:

```
Intelligently merge multiple Obsidian vaults with conflict resolution, content deduplication, and automatic link updating. CLI and GUI interfaces available.
```

### Add Website Link
If you have documentation website, add it in Settings:
- Go to Settings → General
- Add website URL pointing to your documentation

## 3. README Optimization

### Add Badges
Add these badges to your README.md for better visibility:

```markdown
![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8+-blue.svg)
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)
![Tests](https://img.shields.io/badge/tests-24%20passing-brightgreen.svg)
![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/w0nk0/obsidian-bracelet.svg)
```

### Add Table of Contents
Add a TOC to your README for better navigation:

```markdown
## Table of Contents
- [Features](#features)
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Documentation](#documentation)
- [Contributing](#contributing)
```

## 4. GitHub Releases

### Create a Comprehensive Release
When creating your v1.0 release:
- Use a descriptive title: "Release 1.0: Production-ready Obsidian Vault Merger"
- Include detailed changelog
- Add screenshots of the GUI
- Include installation instructions
- Add example usage commands

### Add Binary Releases (Optional)
Consider adding pre-built executables:
- Use GitHub Actions to build executables for different platforms
- Attach them to your releases for easier installation

## 5. Documentation Enhancement

### Create a Docs Folder
Add a `docs/` folder with additional documentation:
- `docs/user-guide.md` - Detailed user guide
- `docs/api-reference.md` - API documentation
- `docs/troubleshooting.md` - Common issues and solutions
- `docs/contributing.md` - Contribution guidelines

### Add GitHub Pages
Set up GitHub Pages for your documentation:
1. Go to Settings → Pages
2. Select source as "Deploy from a branch"
3. Choose "main" branch and "/docs" folder
4. Add comprehensive documentation to the docs folder

## 6. Community Engagement

### Add Contributing Guidelines
Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` with:
- How to set up development environment
- Coding standards
- Pull request process
- Issue reporting guidelines

### Add Issue Templates
Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` with templates:
- `bug_report.md` - For reporting bugs
- `feature_request.md` - For requesting features
- `question.md` - For asking questions

### Add Pull Request Template
Create `.github/pull_request_template.md` with:
- Checklist for PR requirements
- Testing requirements
- Documentation updates

## 7. Social Proof and Validation

### Add Code of Conduct
Create `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` to show your project is welcoming:
- Use Contributor Covenant
- Shows project maturity and community focus

### Add License
Ensure you have a clear `LICENSE` file:
- MIT license is recommended for open source projects
- Add license badge to README

### Add Security Policy
Create `SECURITY.md` to show you take security seriously:
- Vulnerability reporting process
- Security best practices

## 8. GitHub Actions

### Add CI/CD Workflow
Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, "3.10", "3.11"]
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -e .
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        pytest tests/ -v
```

### Add Release Workflow
Create `.github/workflows/release.yml` to automate releases:
- Automatically create releases when tags are pushed
- Build and attach executables
- Update documentation

## 9. Cross-Promotion

### Share on Relevant Platforms
- Reddit: r/Obsidian, r/Productivity, r/Python

- Monitor clone and visitor statistics
- Track referrer sources

### Add Usage Analytics (Optional)
Consider adding anonymous usage tracking:
- Track feature usage
- Monitor error rates
- Gather user feedback
